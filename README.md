# Evolving ETL
A series of data pipelines demonstrating Prefect Core workflow semantics.Each data pipeline builds on the previous level, adding features and functionality to every subsequent flow.

The evolving flow levels demonstrate the following:
    
* Level 1 - Functional & Imperative API, task decorators, flow context, data dependencies, Task subclassing, flow methods

* Level 2 - Flow Dynamism, Parameters, mapping, control flow semantics

* Level 3 - Task & Flow Level Configuration, Results, retries, triggers

* Level 4 - Orchestration, utility functions, state handlers, parameterized scheduling

* Level 5 - Deployment, storage, flow environments, executors, registering to Prefect Cloud
