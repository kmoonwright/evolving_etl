# Evolving ETL
A series of data pipelines demonstrating Prefect Core/Cloud workflow semantics. Each data pipeline builds on the previous level, adding features and functionality with every subsequent flow.


Each level of the Evolving ETL demonstrates the following:

## Local Evolving ETL
* **Level 1** - Functional & Imperative API, task decorators, flow context, data dependencies, Task subclassing, flow methods

* **Level 2** - Flow/task dynamism, parameters, mapping, control flow semantics, parameterized scheduling

* **Level 3** - Task level configurations, retries, results, triggers, state handlers, logger

## Cloud Evolving ETL
* **Level 1** - Functional & Imperative API, task decorators, flow context, data dependencies, Task subclassing, flow methods

* **Level 2** - Flow Dynamism, Parameters, mapping, control flow semantics

* **Level 3** - Task & Flow Level Configuration, Results, retries, triggers

* **Level 4** - Orchestration, utility functions, state handlers, parameterized scheduling

* **Level 5a** - Deployment, storage, flow environments, executors, registering to Prefect Cloud

* **Level 5b** - Supplementary yaml file
